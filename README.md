# tinycom
a tiny modem terminal in C

a simplistic modem terminal. 

Proven to work well with most BBSes, assuming that your (emulated) modem supports telnet. I use tcpser and tty0tty for this end.

options are kept in .tinycom in the local folder, this file is created automatically with default options.

executable is under 22kb in Debian and CPU usage in minimum.
